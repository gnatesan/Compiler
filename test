Project 6
2/16/14

This project took me approximately 11 hours. I collaborated with Nicholas Corl. This assignment was extremely
hard for me. I am glad that I was granted an extension for it. Some parts were not hard, they just took a 
long time, such as hard coding binary representations of certain parts of the instruction. The difficult
part for me was mainly with String parsing. I had a lot of errors with reading the file and evaluating 
the different types of instructions. I spent over half of my time debugging my code.
